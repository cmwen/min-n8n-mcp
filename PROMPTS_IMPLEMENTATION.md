# MCP Prompts Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented 4 predefined prompts for the n8n MCP server as requested in issue #18:

1. **Daily Dashboard** (`daily-dashboard`) - Comprehensive dashboard summary
2. **Analyze Issues** (`analyze-issues`) - Failed execution analysis with patterns and suggestions
3. **Create Workflow from Existing** (`create-workflow-from-existing`) - Guidance for workflow creation from templates
4. **Toggle Workflow Status** (`toggle-workflow-status`) - Easy workflow activation/deactivation interface

## Implementation Details

### Architecture
- Added `prompts/` directory with modular prompt implementations
- Each prompt is a separate TypeScript module with proper error handling
- Integrated prompts into the MCP server with capability registration
- Added support for prompt arguments using MCP SDK compatible schemas

### Prompt Features
- **Daily Dashboard**: Summarizes active workflows, execution statistics, failure analysis, and actionable recommendations
- **Issues Analysis**: Configurable timeframe, error pattern recognition, node failure tracking, and resolution suggestions
- **Workflow Creation**: Template analysis, modification guidance, example JSON structures, and tool recommendations
- **Status Toggle**: Individual and bulk operations, status reporting, and execution planning

### Technical Implementation
- Uses MCP SDK's `registerPrompt()` method with proper argument schemas
- Integrates with existing resource clients (workflows, executions, etc.)
- Structured prompt responses with user/assistant message patterns
- Comprehensive error handling and fallback responses
- TypeScript type safety throughout

### Code Quality
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ Project builds successfully 
- ⚠️ Some stylistic linting issues (template literals, forEach usage) - functional but not blocking

## Testing
- Server initialization succeeds with prompt registration
- Configuration validation passes
- Error handling works (tested with n8n connection failure)
- All 4 prompts are properly registered and available

## Usage
The prompts can be called via MCP clients with arguments:
- `daily-dashboard` (no args)
- `analyze-issues` (timeframe, workflowId, includeSuccessful)
- `create-workflow-from-existing` (sourceWorkflowId, newWorkflowName, description, copyTags)
- `toggle-workflow-status` (action, workflowId, workflowName, bulkAction, tag)

Each prompt returns structured guidance and actionable information for n8n workflow management.
