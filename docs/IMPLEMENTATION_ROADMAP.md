# Implementation Roadmap: Local n8n MCP Server

## Overview
This roadmap breaks down the implementation of the local n8n MCP server into manageable stages. Each stage builds upon the previous one and can be implemented by LLMs/Copilot following the detailed task files.

## Implementation Stages

### Stage 1: Foundation Setup
**Duration**: 1-2 days  
**File**: `STAGE_1_FOUNDATION.md`  
**Goal**: Set up the project structure, tooling, and basic configuration

- Project scaffolding and dependencies
- TypeScript configuration
- Build tooling (tsup, biome)
- Basic CLI structure
- Configuration management

### Stage 2: HTTP Client Infrastructure  
**Duration**: 2-3 days  
**File**: `STAGE_2_HTTP_CLIENT.md`  
**Goal**: Implement robust HTTP client with retries, timeouts, and error handling

- HTTP client with fetch wrapper
- Error mapping and custom error classes
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Rate limiting and concurrency control
- Logging infrastructure

### Stage 3: MCP Server Core
**Duration**: 2-3 days  
**File**: `STAGE_3_MCP_CORE.md`  
**Goal**: Set up MCP server with STDIO and HTTP mode support

- MCP server bootstrap
- Tool registration system
- JSON Schema integration
- STDIO and HTTP mode support
- Basic tool framework

### Stage 4: Resource Clients
**Duration**: 3-4 days  
**File**: `STAGE_4_RESOURCE_CLIENTS.md`  
**Goal**: Implement all n8n API resource clients

- Workflow operations
- Execution management
- Credential handling
- User and project management
- Tags, variables, audit, source control

### Stage 5: Tool Implementation
**Duration**: 4-5 days  
**File**: `STAGE_5_TOOLS.md`  
**Goal**: Implement all MCP tools with proper validation

- Workflow tools (CRUD, activate/deactivate, etc.)
- Execution tools
- Credential tools
- Management tools (users, projects, tags, variables)
- Advanced tools (audit, source control)

### Stage 6: Testing & Quality
**Duration**: 2-3 days  
**File**: `STAGE_6_TESTING.md`  
**Goal**: Comprehensive testing and quality assurance

- Unit tests for all modules
- Integration tests for both STDIO and HTTP modes
- Error handling validation
- Performance testing
- Security validation

### Stage 7: Documentation & Release
**Duration**: 1-2 days  
**File**: `STAGE_7_RELEASE.md`  
**Goal**: Final documentation, CI/CD, and release preparation

- User documentation
- API documentation
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Release automation
- Performance optimization

## Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 18
- pnpm package manager
- Access to n8n instance for testing
- Understanding of MCP (Model Context Protocol)

## Success Criteria
- ✅ All tools from PRD are implemented and functional
- ✅ Both STDIO and HTTP modes work correctly
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and logging
- ✅ >90% test coverage
- ✅ Published to npm and ready for use
- ✅ MCP Inspector compatibility verified

## Risk Mitigation
- **OpenAPI gaps**: Use permissive typing initially, improve iteratively
- **Missing endpoints**: Document workarounds, implement client-side alternatives
- **n8n version compatibility**: Keep mapping thin, add version detection if needed

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve this roadmap
2. Begin with Stage 1: Foundation Setup
3. Follow each stage sequentially
4. Validate deliverables before moving to next stage
